#Memory

Image as a canvas with 20 slots and finite number of slots and it is bounded canvas.
The less teh memeory you take with the dsa , so more better it is.

So, we need an algorithm.

When ever you define a variable, you program will store that variable in memort slots/ or series of memeory slots if its free !!

In Java, int has 32bit size, or in one slot, we store 8 bits, or 1 byte in one slots, or it will require 4 slots,- here we are talking about fixed size integers. 

###So the size will always be consitant !!

Back to Back store they will store back to back !!

## How about when we store list ??

[1,2] here for int types, the list of lenght two has two integer, so it needs 8 back to back memory slots.
, If there were something in between, the array will store at a different memory address !!



## How do we store strings ???

ASCI code will assign a bunch of character with codes, so everyalphabest has ascii value and then that value will be changes into int and binary code .

Memory address == slots !!

## Pointer ??
In a memeory address/slot i can store the point to another address slots. I can points to another memory address that has the data we need.

So pointer we can point that is super far away, un like the previous one, where they have to be back to back. !!


OUR COMPUTER CAN ACCESS THERE MEMEORY SLOTS EXTREMLY QUICLY...
