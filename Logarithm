## Log(N) means in the context of complexity analysis.

log b (x)=y   if and only if  b^y=x ;

When we talk about log, we need to talk about the base,
when we talk about when we talk about log, the default base is 2.

In math the log was base 10, but in computer- 2 is the best one.

here N is the input, 
so log(n) is good as input doubles, the nunber of elementary operations that in the algorithm only increase by 1.

so O(log(n)) > O(n)

for example, 2^20 == some million where are 2^30 == some billion, so here the complexity of log(n) really understand the complexity where,
the complexity doesnot increase as compared to how the input has increased significently.
