# Interview-Preparation-2025
Getting inspired from one of my friend who recently cracked lots of interview. 
(attended 1 round of interview including technical discussions, coding and system design.)

This repository contains my complete prepration journey for the _____(name of the company) Interview process. The codes are uploaded as i do it. I chose python and java during problem solving. 

I went through 1 Interview with Siemens. Although I was not selected in the end, I want to share my prepration openly so other can benefits from it. This repo includes coding problem , system design notes and technical analysis exercies that i worked on while preparing. 

I made some silly mistake duing that interview, and now i am preparing myself before i sit on any interview. 



While preparing for the interview, I would also use cursor IDE. So i will try to use AI to learn all the stuffs as fast as possible. 

lets see how it goes.

Why I'm sharing this ?
